Linux Debugging wireless Modules : The Linux foundation
Overview  Linux WiFi  basic concepts - Chips and stack 

Category:
Full mac /soft mac
FW
Interfaces
BT coex

MLME resides on chips or FW running in the HW - Full MAC
MLME resides on linux mac80211 layer  - Soft MAC

Both of them have FW blobs provided to you by vendor(QCA, Broadcomm, Marvel) may and may not be upstream 
FW blobs should be load as late as possible, some on during probe wifi drivers
Most chips load FW, even Soft MAC loads FW (thin FW layer) 
/lib/firmware

Interfaces:
Most drivers have multiple h/w interfaces, Majority uses
-SDIO
-USB
-PCIE
-AXI

Pins :
UART
BT coex


Arch :
userspace (utilities, network manager, supplicant, debugfs, apps)

kernal(nl80211				------->relates to Syscall interface
	   cfg80211              ------>relates to Syscall Interfaces & Sockets
	   mac80211              ------> relates to protocols
	   Either Soft MAC or Full mac Interface drivers (Ath10k)---->relates to net_dev
	   USB, PCIE, SDIO, AXI)
|
Hardware(Bus Interface HW,
		WiFi chip)


mac80211:
SDIO, PCIE drivers to get stuffs to and from from the chips
Have an abstraction layer
->ieee80211_ops 
->ieee80211_allow_hw
->ieee80211_register_hw


cfg80211:
replaces wext
All drivers uses this
Ex : scan , regulatory domains, rate table array


nl802111:
basic tools talk to nl80211 to talk to cfg80211 and mqc80211
Userspace interface to cgf80211
Uses netlink socket
replaces wext along with cfg80211

Userspace mgmt:
iw uses netlink socket
iwconfig, ifconfig, iwpriv (Depriciated, uses ioctl we do still use this)



wpa_supplicant/hostapd :
handles encryption stuffs and all encryption protocols
some chips offload this into there FW drivers & all needs to setup all this correct)


Data :
No differnce talking to ethernet or WiFi devices
opens up an app -> sets the sockets -> TCP/IP stack
Data path (All skb's)




cat vendor 
0x271(Atheros)

cat device
0x301


Looks driver code :
hif.h will have device id 
sdio.c 

or check dmesg or maybe it will say that didn't able to load the firmware5.bin



Bad results:
Is it plugged in correctly?
Is it powered?
Does it announce on bus?
Does it loads FW ?
If it fails to load wifi interface wlan0?
Functionality failures
Performance failures

Names of the firmware is generally hardcoded in device drivers. 
Blobs that are loaded :
1)Actual FW
2)Board data files inclues Antena power adjustment , regulatory compliance

If you want to debug lower layer it's better to remove the Network manager


Debugging:
check vendorId, deviceId and try checkin the driver code if it exist ir not
lspvi -nn
lsusb
sdio- > uses sysfs
cat /sys/bus/sdio/devices/mmc00:0001:1


1)kconfig debuging options -> by default it is disabled 
Ex : ath10kl_debug, ath10kl_tracing
brcmfmac : CONFIG_BRCMDBG

2)dmesg - >kernal logs
echo 0x00140000 > /sys/module/ath10kl_core/paramentes/debugmask
